KMeans Clustering for Purchase History in a Shop

Overview
This project applies KMeans clustering to analyze and segment customer purchase history in a shop. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behaviors, which can be used for targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib (optional, for visualization)
seaborn (optional, for visualization)
You can install the required libraries using pip:
  pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Additional Notes
To improve clustering results, consider including more features such as purchase frequency, recency, and product categories.
Experiment with different numbers of clusters and evaluate the results using metrics like the silhouette score.
For more advanced analysis, consider using clustering techniques such as DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering.
